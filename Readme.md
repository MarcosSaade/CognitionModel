# Cognition Model: AI in Cognitive Development
<hr>

## Project Overview
This project explores cognitive abilities within an AI model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built using PyTorch, designed to emulate aspects of human cognition. The model has been developed for a **Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches** course (IB, 12th grade), where it replicates tasks from a well-known cognitive test.

### Key Highlights
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Architecture**: Built and trained using PyTorch to simulate cognitive tasks, evaluating problem-solving and learning capabilities.
- **Cognitive Test**: Inspired by Siegler’s study on cognitive development (Siegler, R. S., 1976). The test assesses decision-making abilities in balance scale tasks, where weight and distance are factored in to predict outcomes.
- **Training Dataset**: Drawn from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository’s Balance Scale dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Balance+Scale).
- **Model Performance**: Achieved prediction accuracy ranging from 93% to 99%, demonstrating competitive performance compared to human participants aged 6-18.

### About the Cognitive Task
The cognitive task is a balance scale problem where the model predicts which side of the scale will tilt, based on weight and distance inputs. This approach mirrors cognitive challenge levels presented to human participants.

### Project Deliverables
- **Codebase**: Detailed implementation of the ANN in PyTorch, including forward and backward propagation, gradient descent optimization, and weight adjustment.
- **Project Report**: Comprehensive analysis, in Spanish, on the model's performance versus human participants. Available in this repository as a PDF.
- **Learning Outcome**: Validates machine learning applications in cognitive development, providing insights into potential AI advancements in replicating human-like problem-solving skills.
